# Resource: aws_launch_template

Provides an EC2 launch template resource. Can be used to create instances or auto scaling groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_launch_template" "example" {
  name = "tf-lt"

  block_device_mappings {
    device_name = "disk1"

    ebs {
      volume_size = 20
    }
  }

  disable_api_termination = true

  instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior = "terminate"

  image_id      = "cmi-12345678" # add image id, change instance type if needed
  instance_type = "m1.micro"

  monitoring {
    enabled = true
  }

  placement {
    availability_zone = "ru-msk-vol52"
  }

  tag_specifications {
    resource_type = "instance"

    tags = {
      Name = "tf-lt"
    }
  }
}
```

### Block devices

Configure additional volumes of the instance besides specified by the image.

To find out more information for an existing image to override the configuration, such as `device_name`, use the [EC2 API][describe-images].

Each `block_device_mappings` supports the following:

* `device_name` - (Optional) The name of the device to mount.
* `ebs` - (Optional) Configure EBS volume properties.
* `no_device` - (Optional) Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping.

The `ebs` block supports the following:

* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination.
* `iops` - (Optional) The amount of provisioned IOPS. This must be set with a volume_type of `io2`.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The snapshot ID to mount.
* `volume_size` - (Optional) The size of the volume in gigabytes.
* `volume_type` - (Optional) Type of volume. Valid values are `st2`, `gp2`, `io2`.

### Monitoring

The `monitoring` block supports the following:

* `enabled` - If `true`, the launched EC2 instance will have detailed monitoring enabled.

### Network Interfaces

Attaches one or more network interfaces to the instance.

For the details about configuring network interfaces when creating an auto scaling group, see the [user documentation][asg-create].

Each `network_interfaces` block supports the following:

* `associate_public_ip_address` - (Optional) Whether a public IP address should be associated with the network interface.
  The address will be assigned to the `eth0` interface if there are free allocated external addresses.
  This operation is available only for instances running in the VPC and for new network interfaces.

* `private_ip_address` - (Optional) The primary private IPv4 address.
* `security_groups` - (Optional) A list of security group IDs to associate.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The VPC subnet ID to associate.

### Placement

The placement group of the instance.

The `placement` block supports the following:

* `affinity` - (Optional) The affinity setting for an instance on a dedicated host. The parameter could be set to `host` only if `tenancy` is `host`.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The availability zone for the instance.
* `group_name` - (Optional) The name of the placement group for the instance.

~> **Note** If you use the `host` value, you may encounter the `NotEnoughResourcesForInstanceType` error when running an instance. To avoid this, it is recommended to provide either the `subnet_id` argument or the `availability_zone` argument.

### Tag Specifications

The tags to apply to the resources during launch. You can tag instances and volumes.

Each `tag_specifications` block supports the following:

* `resource_type` - (Optional) The type of resource to tag. Valid values are `instance`, `volume`.
