# Rockit Cloud Provider

The Rockit Cloud Provider is based on the AWS Provider.
It is designed for managing resources in public and private clouds based on K2 Cloud and Rockit Cloud platforms.
The provider must be configured with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation on the left to read about the available resources.

~> **Note**
Resource names in the navigation bar have an automatically generated prefix that matches the *rockitcloud* name.
For compatibility with AWS provider configurations, we retained the ``aws`` prefix in resource description and usage examples.

To learn the basics of Terraform using this provider, follow the
hands-on [get started tutorials][hashicorp-tutorials] on HashiCorp's Learn platform.

Examples of using Rockit Cloud services with Terraform can be found in [reference test suite on GitHub][c2-tutorials].

Rockit Cloud API is based on AWS API so you can also see examples of using AWS services with Terraform: [AWS services tutorials][aws-tutorials].

## Example Usage

For Terraform 0.13 and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "c2devel/rockitcloud"
      version = "~> 25.4"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the rockitcloud provider.
# The section is named `aws` for backward compatibility.
provider "aws" {
  # For K2 Cloud, specify one of the supported regions.
  # For other cloud platforms, enter a non-empty string,
  # for example, "region-1", and API endpoints.
  region = "ru-msk"
}

# Create a VPC.
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Authentication and Configuration

Configuration for the Rockit Cloud Provider can be derived from several sources,
which are applied in the following order:

1. Parameters in the provider configuration.
2. Environment variables.
3. Shared configuration and credentials files.

### Provider Configuration

!> **Warning:** Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform
configuration because they run the risk of secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Credentials can be provided by adding `access_key` and `secret_key` to the `aws` provider block.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region     = "ru-msk"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}
```

#### API Endpoints

The Rockit Cloud Provider manages resources via API calls. To connect the provider to the cloud platform,
you must specify the platform API endpoints in the `provider.endpoints` block or define the corresponding environment variables.

-> **Note**
When connecting to K2 Cloud, you can specify one of [the supported regions][k2-supported-regions] in the configuration.
In this case, the `provider.endpoints` block can be omitted,
because the provider will generate all API endpoints based on the region value.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  endpoints {
    # It is recommended to always specify the `ec2` endpoint,
    # because the provider uses it for service calls.
    ec2 = "https://ec2.api.url"
    s3  = "https://s3.api.url"
  }
  # ...
}
```

The resulting set of endpoints depends on what resources are used.
An API endpoint can be set using the corresponding provider parameter.

| Auto Scaling                       | `autoscaling`      |                      |
| Backup                             | `backup`           |                      |
| CloudWatch                         | `cloudwatch`       |                      |
| Direct Connect                     | `directconnect`    | `DIRECT_CONNECT_URL` |
| EBS (EC2)                          | `ec2`              | `EC2_URL`            |
| EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)        | `ec2`              | `EC2_URL`            |
| EFS (Elastic File System)          | `efs`              |                      |
| EKS (Elastic Kubernetes)           | `eks`              |                      |
| ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)       | `elbv2`            |                      |
| IAM (Identity & Access Management) | `iam`              | `IAM_URL`            |

| Transit Gateway                    | `ec2`              | `EC2_URL`            |
| S3 (Simple Storage)                | `s3`               |                      |

| VPN (Site-to-Site)                 | `ec2`              | `EC2_URL`            |

### Environment Variables

Credentials can also be provided by using the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
The region can be set using the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables.

For example:

```terraform
provider "aws" {}
```

```sh
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="my-access-key"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="my-secret-key"
$ export AWS_REGION="ru-msk"
$ terraform plan
```

Some API endpoints may also be provided via environment variables (see the [API Endpoints section](#api-endpoints)).

### Shared Configuration and Credentials Files

Rockit Cloud Provider can use [AWS shared configuration and credentials files][aws-configure-files] and source credentials and other settings from them.
By default, these files are located at `$HOME/.aws/config` and `$HOME/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS,
and `"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config"` and `"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"` on Windows.

If no named profile is specified, the `default` profile is used.
Use the `profile` parameter or `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` environment variables to specify a named profile.

The locations of the shared configuration and credentials files can be configured using either
the parameters `shared_config_files` and `shared_credentials_files`
or the environment variables `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`.

For example:

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  shared_config_files      = ["/Users/tf_user/.aws/conf"]
  shared_credentials_files = ["/Users/tf_user/.aws/creds"]
  profile                  = "customprofile"
}
```
