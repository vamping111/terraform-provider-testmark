# Resource: aws_ami

Manages an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
If you just want to share an existing image with another project,
it's better to use [`aws_ami_launch_permission`](ami_launch_permission.md) instead.

For more information about images, see [user documentation][images].

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Creates an image that will start a machine whose root device is backed by
# an EBS volume populated from a snapshot. It is assumed that such a snapshot
# already exists with the ID "snap-12345678".
resource "aws_ami" "example" {
  name                = "tf-ami"
  virtualization_type = "hvm"
  root_device_name    = "disk1"

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "disk1"
    snapshot_id = "snap-12345678"
    volume_size = 8
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) An unique name for the image.
* `architecture` - (Optional) Machine architecture for created instances.
    * _Default value:_ `x86_64`
* `description` - (Optional) A longer, human-readable description for the image.
* `ebs_block_device` - (Optional) List of EBS block devices that should be
  attached to created instances. The structure of this block is [described below](#ebs_block_device).
* `ephemeral_block_device` - (Optional) List of ephemeral block devices that
  should be attached to created instances. The structure of this block is [described below](#ephemeral_block_device).
* `root_device_name` - (Optional) The name of the root device.
    * _Valid values:_ `disk<N>`, `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>`, `menu`, where `<N>` is a disk number
    * _Default value:_ `disk1`
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the image. If a provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags] is used, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider level.
* `virtualization_type` - (Optional) Keyword to choose what virtualization mode created instances will use.
    * _Valid values:_ `hvm`, `hvm-legacy`
    * _Default value:_ `hvm`

### ebs_block_device

The `ebs_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` - (Required) The device name of one or more block device mapping entries.
    * _Valid values:_ `disk<N>`, `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>`, where `<N>` is a disk number
* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Controls whether the EBS volumes will be deleted once the instance for which they were created is terminated.
    * _Default value:_ `true`
* `iops` - (Optional) Number of I/O operations per second the
  created volumes will support.
    * _Constraints:_ Required if `volume_type` is `io2`
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of an EBS snapshot that will be used to initialize the created
  EBS volumes.
    * _Constraints:_ If set, the `volume_size` attribute must be at least as large as the referenced snapshot
* `volume_size` - (Optional) The size of created volumes in GiB.
    * _Constraints:_ Required unless `snapshot_id` is set. If `snapshot_id` is set and `volume_size` is omitted then the volume will have the same size as the selected snapshot
* `volume_type` - (Optional) The type of EBS volume to create.
    * _Default value:_ `st2`

### ephemeral_block_device

The `ephemeral_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` - (Required) The device name of one or more block device mapping entries.
    * _Valid values:_ `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>`, where `<N>` is a disk number
* `virtual_name` - (Required) A name for the ephemeral device.
    * _Constraints:_ Must match with the device name

## Attribute Reference

### Supported attributes

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image.
* `id` - The ID of the created image.
* `image_owner_alias` - The alias of the image owner.
* `image_type` - The type of the image.
* `owner_id` - The ID of the image owner.
* `platform` - The platform of the image.
* `public` - Indicates whether the image has public launch permissions.
* `root_snapshot_id` - The ID of the snapshot for the root volume (for EBS-backed images).
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the image, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags].

### Unsupported attributes

~> **Note** These attributes may be present in the ``terraform.tfstate`` file, but their values are preset and cannot be specified in configuration files.

The following attributes are not currently supported:

`boot_mode`, `deprecation_time`, `ebs_block_device.encrypted`, `ebs_block_device.kms_key_id`, `ebs_block_device.outpost_arn`, `ebs_block_device.throughput`, `ena_support`, `hypervisor`, `image_location`, `kernel_id`, `platform_details`, `ramdisk_id`, `sriov_net_support`, `usage_operation`.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts] for certain actions:

* `create` - (Default `40 minutes`) Used when creating the image.
* `update` - (Default `40 minutes`) Used when updating the image.
* `delete` - (Default `90 minutes`) Used when deregistering the image.

## Import

`aws_ami` can be imported using the ID of the image, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ami.example cmi-12345678
```
