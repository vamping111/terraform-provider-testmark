# Resource: aws_eip

Manages an Elastic IP. For more information about EIPs, see [user documentation][elastic-ips].

## Example Usage

### Single EIP associated with an instance

```terraform
resource "aws_eip" "example" {
  instance = "i-12345678"
  vpc      = true
}
```

### Attaching an EIP to an instance with a pre-assigned private IP

```terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "default" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "tf_test_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.default.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/24"
}

resource "aws_instance" "foo" {
  ami           = "cmi-12345678" # add image id, change instance type if needed
  instance_type = "m1.micro"

  private_ip = "10.0.0.12"
  subnet_id  = aws_subnet.tf_test_subnet.id
}

resource "aws_eip" "bar" {
  vpc = true

  associate_with_private_ip = "10.0.0.12"
}
```

### Allocating EIP from the BYOIP pool

```terraform
resource "aws_eip" "byoip-ip" {
  vpc              = true
  public_ipv4_pool = "ipv4pool-ec2-012345"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `address` - (Optional) IP address from an EC2 BYOIP pool.
    _Constraints:_ This option is only available for VPC EIPs
* `associate_with_private_ip` - (Optional) User-specified primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the elastic IP address.
    * _Constraints:_ If no private IP address is specified, the elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address
* `instance` - (Optional) The ID of the EC2 instance.
* `network_interface` - (Optional) The ID of the network interface to associate with.
* `public_ipv4_pool` - (Optional) The ID of the EC2 IPv4 address pool.
    * _Constraints:_ This option is only available for VPC EIPs
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the EIP. If a provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags] is used, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider level.
    * _Constraints:_ Tags can only be applied to EIPs in a VPC
* `vpc` - (Optional) Boolean if the EIP is in a VPC or not.

~> **Note** You can specify either the ID of `instance` or the ID of `network_interface`, but not both.

~> **Note** If both `public_ipv4_pool` and `address` are specified, `address` will be used in the case both options are defined as API only requires one or the other.

## Attribute Reference

### Supported attributes

~> **Note** The data source computes the `public_dns` and `private_dns` attributes according to the [AWS VPC DNS Guide][vpc-dns-guide] as they are not available with the EC2 API.

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `allocation_id` - The ID representing the allocation of the IP address.
* `association_id` - The ID representing the association of the allocation of the IP-address with an instance or a private IP address.
* `domain` - Indicates if this EIP is for use in VPC (`vpc`).
* `id` - The ID of the EIP allocation.
* `private_ip` - Contains the private IP address. Can be `""` if `associate_with_private_ip` is specified.
* `public_ip` - Contains the public IP address.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the EIP, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags].

### Unsupported attributes

~> **Note** These attributes may be present in the `terraform.tfstate` file, but they have preset values and cannot be specified in configuration files.

The following attributes are not currently supported:

`carrier_ip`, `customer_owned_ip`, `customer_owned_ipv4_pool`, `network_border_group`, `private_dns`, `public_dns`.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts] for certain actions:

- `read` - (Default `15 minutes`) How long to wait querying for information about EIPs.
- `update` - (Default `5 minutes`) How long to wait for an EIP to be updated.
- `delete` - (Default `3 minutes`) How long to wait for an EIP to be deleted.

## Import

EIPs in a VPC can be imported using their allocation ID, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_eip.bar eipalloc-1234567
```

EIPs can be imported using their public IP, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_eip.bar 1.1.1.1
```
