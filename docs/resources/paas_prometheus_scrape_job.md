  service_id = aws_paas_service.prometheus.id

  name = "appmetrics"
  targets = [
    "app-01.internal:9090",
    "app-02.internal:9090",
  ]
  labels = {
    env  = "production"
    team = "platform"
  }
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `service_id` - (Required, Forces new resource) The ID of the PaaS Prometheus service.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) The name of the scrape job. Must start with a Latin letter,
