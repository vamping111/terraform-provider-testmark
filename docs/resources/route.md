# Resource: aws_route

Creates a routing table entry (a route) in a VPC routing table.

~> **Note on route tables and routes** Terraform currently provides both a standalone route resource and a [`aws_route_table`](route_table.md) resource with routes defined inline. At this time you cannot use a route table with inline routes in conjunction with any route resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.

## Example usage

### Basic example

```terraform
variable route_table_id {}
variable instance_id {}

resource "aws_route" "example" {
  route_table_id         = var.route_table_id
  destination_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/22"
  instance_id            = var.instance_id
}
```

## Argument reference

The following argument is supported:

* `route_table_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the routing table.

The following destination argument must be supplied:

* `destination_cidr_block` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The destination CIDR block.

One of the following target arguments must be supplied:

* `gateway_id` - (Optional, Editable, String) The ID of the internet gateway.
* `network_interface_id` - (Optional, Editable, String) The ID of the network interface.
* `transit_gateway_id` - (Optional, Editable, String) The ID of the transit gateway.

This argument is **deprecated** and should not be used:

* `instance_id` - (Optional, Editable, String) The ID of the instance. Use the `network_interface_id` argument instead.

## Attribute reference

### Supported attributes

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

~> **Note** Only the arguments that are configured (one of the above) will be exported as an attribute once the resource is created.

* `id` - (String) The route identifier computed from the routing table identifier and route destination.
* `instance_owner_id` - (String) The ID of the project that owns the instance.
* `origin` - (String) Describes how the route was created - by `CreateRouteTable`, `CreateRoute` or `EnableVgwRoutePropagation`.
* `state` - (String) The state of the route - `active` or `blackhole`.

### Unsupported attributes

~> **Note** These attributes may be present in the `terraform.tfstate` file, but they have preset values and cannot be specified in configuration files.

The following attributes are not currently supported:

`carrier_gateway_id`, `core_network_arn`, `destination_ipv6_cidr_block`, `destination_prefix_list_id`, `egress_only_gateway_id`, `local_gateway_id`, `nat_gateway_id`, `vpc_endpoint_id`, `vpc_peering_connection_id`.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts] for certain actions:

- `create` - (Default `5 minutes`) Used for route creation.
- `update` - (Default `2 minutes`) Used for route creation.
- `delete` - (Default `5 minutes`) Used for route deletion.

## Import

Individual routes can be imported using `ROUTETABLEID_DESTINATION`.
For example, import a route in route table `rtb-12345678` with an IPv4 destination CIDR of `10.1.0.0/16` like this:

```console
$ terraform import aws_route.my_route rtb-12345678_10.1.0.0/16
```
