# Resource: aws_route53_record

Manages a Route53 record.

## Example Usage

### Simple routing policy

```terraform
resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
  name    = "www.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [aws_eip.lb.public_ip]
}
```

### NS Record Management

When creating Route 53 zones, the `NS` records for the zone are automatically created. Enabling the `allow_overwrite` argument will allow managing these records in a single Terraform run without the requirement for `terraform import`.

```terraform
resource "aws_route53_zone" "example" {
  name = "test.example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  allow_overwrite = true
  name            = "test.example.com"
  ttl             = 172800
  type            = "NS"
  zone_id         = aws_route53_zone.example.zone_id

  records = [
    aws_route53_zone.example.name_servers[0],
    aws_route53_zone.example.name_servers[1],
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the record.
* `type` - (Required) The record type.
    * _Valid values:_ `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR`, `SRV` and `TXT`
* `ttl` - (Required) The TTL of the record.
* `records` - (Required) A string list of records. To specify a single record value longer than 255 characters such as a TXT record for DKIM, add `\" \"` inside the Terraform configuration string to split characters into multiple text strings (e.g., `"first255characters\" \"next255characters"`).
* `zone_id` - (Required) The ID of the hosted zone to contain this record.
* `allow_overwrite` - (Optional) Allow creation of this record in Terraform to overwrite an existing record, if any. This does not affect the ability to update the record in Terraform and does not prevent other resources within Terraform or manual Route 53 changes outside Terraform from overwriting this record. `false` by default. This configuration is not recommended for most environments.

## Attribute Reference

### Supported attributes

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `fqdn` - [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) built using the zone domain and `name`.
* `name` - The name of the record.

### Unsupported attributes

~> **Note** These attributes may be present in the `terraform.tfstate` file, but they have preset values and cannot be specified in configuration files.

The following attributes are not currently supported:

`alias`, `failover_routing_policy`, `geolocation_routing_policy`, `health_check_id`, `latency_routing_policy`, `multivalue_answer_routing_policy`, `set_identifier`, `weighted_routing_policy`.

## Import

Route53 records can be imported using ID of the record, which is the zone identifier, record name, and record type, separated by underscores (`_`)E.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_route53_record.myrecord z-xxxxxxxx_dev.example.com_NS
```
