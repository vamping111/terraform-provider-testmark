# Resource: aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation

Requests automatic route propagation between a VPN gateway and a route table.

~> **Note** This resource should not be used with a route table that has
the `propagating_vgws` argument set. If that argument is set, any route
propagation not explicitly listed in its value will be removed.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** For convenience, the ID of the VPN gateway is the same as the ID of the VPC, to which it belongs (`vpc-ABCD1234`/`vgw-ABCD1234`).

```terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_route_table" "example" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.example.id
}

data "aws_vpn_gateway" "selected" {
  id = aws_vpc.example.id # vpc_id can be used as vpn_gateway_id
}

resource "aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation" "example" {
  vpn_gateway_id = data.aws_vpn_gateway.selected.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `route_table_id` - The ID of the route table to propagate routes into.
* `vpn_gateway_id` - The ID of the VPN gateway to propagate routes from.

## Attribute Reference

No additional attributes are exported.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts] for certain actions:

- `create` - (Default `2 minutes`) Used for propagation creation.
- `delete` - (Default `2 minutes`) Used for propagation deletion.
