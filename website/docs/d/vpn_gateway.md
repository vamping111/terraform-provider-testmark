## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_vpn_gateway" "selected" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["vpn-gw"]
  }
}

output "vpn_gateway_id" {
  value = data.aws_vpn_gateway.selected.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available VPN gateways.
The given filters must match exactly one VPN gateway whose data will be exported as attributes.

* `id` - (Optional) ID of the specific VPN gateway to retrieve.
* `state` - (Optional) The state of the specific VPN gateway to retrieve.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The availability zone of the specific VPN gateway to retrieve.

* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match
  a pair on the desired VPN gateway.

More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the field to filter by it.
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  A VPN Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.
