# Resource: aws_ami

The AMI (Amazon Machine Image) resource allows the creation and management of images.

If you just want to share an existing image with another CROC Cloud account,
it's better to use [`aws_ami_launch_permission`](ami_launch_permission.html.markdown) instead.

For more information about images, see [user documentation][images].

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an image that will start a machine whose root device is backed by
# an EBS volume populated from a snapshot. It is assumed that such a snapshot
# already exists with the id "snap-12345678".
resource "aws_ami" "example" {
  name                = "tf-ami"
  virtualization_type = "hvm"
  root_device_name    = "disk1"

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "disk1"
    snapshot_id = "snap-12345678"
    volume_size = 8
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) An unique name for the image.
* `description` - (Optional) A longer, human-readable description for the image.
* `root_device_name` - (Optional) The name of the root device. Valid values are `disk<N>`, `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>`, `menu` (N - disk number). Defaults to `disk1`.
* `virtualization_type` - (Optional) Keyword to choose what virtualization mode created instances will use. Valid values: `hvm`.
* `architecture` - (Optional) Machine architecture for created instances. Defaults to `x86_64`.
* `ebs_block_device` - (Optional) Nested block describing an EBS block device that should be
  attached to created instances. The structure of this block is described below.
* `ephemeral_block_device` - (Optional) Nested block describing an ephemeral block device that
  should be attached to created instances. The structure of this block is described below.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags] present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

Nested `ebs_block_device` blocks have the following structure:

* `device_name` - (Required) The device name of one or more block device mapping entries. Valid values are `disk<N>`, `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>`, (N - disk number).
* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Boolean controlling whether the EBS volumes created to
  support each created instance will be deleted once that instance is terminated. Defaults to `true`.
* `iops` - (Required only when `volume_type` is `io2`) Number of I/O operations per second the
  created volumes will support.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of an EBS snapshot that will be used to initialize the created
  EBS volumes. If set, the `volume_size` attribute must be at least as large as the referenced
  snapshot.
* `volume_size` - (Required unless `snapshot_id` is set) The size of created volumes in GiB.
  If `snapshot_id` is set and `volume_size` is omitted then the volume will have the same size
  as the selected snapshot.
* `volume_type` - (Optional) The type of EBS volume to create. Valid values are `st2`, `gp2`, `io2`.

Nested `ephemeral_block_device` blocks have the following structure:

* `device_name` - (Required) The device name of one or more block device mapping entries. Valid values are `cdrom<N>`, `floppy<N>` (N - disk number).
* `virtual_name` - (Required) A name for the ephemeral device. Must match with the device name.

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/blocks/resources/syntax.html#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Default `40 minutes`) Used when creating the image
* `update` - (Default `40 minutes`) Used when updating the image
* `delete` - (Default `90 minutes`) Used when deregistering the image

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the image.
* `id` - The ID of the created image.
* `root_snapshot_id` - The Snapshot ID for the root volume (for EBS-backed images)
* `image_owner_alias` - The owner alias (for example, `self`) or the CROC Cloud project ID.
* `image_type` - The type of image.
* `owner_id` - The CROC Cloud project ID.
* `platform` - This value is set to windows for Windows images; otherwise, it is blank.
* `public` - Indicates whether the image has public launch permissions.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags].

->  **Unsupported attributes**
These exported attributes are currently unsupported by CROC Cloud:

* `boot_mode` - The boot mode of the image. Always `""`.
* `deprecation_time` - The date and time to deprecate the image. Always `""`.
* `ena_support` - Specifies whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled. Always `false`.
* `ebs_block_device`:
    * `encrypted` - Whether the disk is encrypted. Always `false`.
    * `kms_key_id` - The ARN for the KMS encryption key. Always `""`.
    * `outpost_arn` - The ARN of the Outpost. Always `""`.
    * `throughput` - The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s. Always `0`.
* `hypervisor` - The hypervisor type of the image. Always `""`.
* `image_location` - Path to an S3 object containing an image manifest. Always `""`.
* `kernel_id` - The id of the kernel image (AKI) that is used as the paravirtual kernel in created instances. Always `""`.
* `platform_details` - The platform details associated with the billing code of the image. Always `""`.
* `ramdisk_id` - (Optional) The id of an initrd image (ARI) that is used when booting the created instances. Always `""`.
* `sriov_net_support` - When set to `simple`, enables enhanced networking for created instances. Always `""`.
* `usage_operation` - The operation of the Amazon EC2 instance and the billing code that is associated with the image. Always `""`.

## Import

`aws_ami` can be imported using the ID of the image, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ami.example cmi-12345678
```
