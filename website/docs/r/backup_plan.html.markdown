  rule {
    rule_name         = "tf-backup-rule"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault_default.example.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 12 * * *)"
    start_window      = 60
    completion_window = 180

    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 30
    }
  }

  rule {
    rule_name         = "tf-backup-rule2"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault_default.example.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 23 * * *)"
    start_window      = 60
    completion_window = 180

    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 60
    }
