  Manages an individual EC2 resource tag
---

# Resource: aws_ec2_tag

Manages an individual EC2 resource tag. This resource should only be used in cases where EC2 resources are created outside Terraform (e.g., AMIs).

~> **NOTE:** This tagging resource should not be combined with the Terraform resource for managing the parent resource. For example, using `aws_vpc` and `aws_ec2_tag` to manage tags of the same VPC will cause a perpetual difference where the `aws_vpc` resource will try to remove the tag being added by the `aws_ec2_tag` resource.

~> **NOTE:** This tagging resource does not use the [provider `ignore_tags` configuration](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#ignore_tags).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_ec2_tag" "example" {
  resource_id = "vol-12345678"
  key         = "tag-from-tf"
  value       = "tf-tag"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `resource_id` - (Required) The ID of the EC2 resource to manage the tag for.
* `key` - (Required) The tag name.
* `value` - (Required) The value of the tag.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - EC2 resource identifier and key, separated by a comma (`,`)

## Import

`aws_ec2_tag` can be imported by using the EC2 resource identifier and key, separated by a comma (`,`), e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ec2_tag.example tgw-attach-12345678,Name
```
