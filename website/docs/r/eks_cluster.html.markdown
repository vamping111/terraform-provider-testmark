# Resource: aws_eks_cluster

Manages an EKS cluster. For details about EKS clusters, see the [user documentation][eks-clusters].

->  **Note**
EKS clusters created by Terraform are [high availability clusters][ha-clusters].

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
  name    = "example"
  version = "1.22.3"

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = [aws_subnet.example1.id]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `name` – (Required) The name of the cluster. Must be between 1-100 characters in length. Must begin with an alphanumeric character, and must only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores (`^[0-9A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\-_]+$`).
* `version` – (Required) The Kubernetes server version for the cluster.
* `vpc_config` - (Required) Configuration block for the VPC associated with your cluster. Detailed below. Also contains attributes detailed in the Attributes section.

The following arguments are optional:

* `kubernetes_network_config` - (Optional) Configuration block with kubernetes network configuration for the cluster. Detailed below. If removed, Terraform will only perform drift detection if a configuration value is provided.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags] present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### vpc_config Arguments

* `security_group_ids` – (Optional) List of security group IDs.
* `subnet_ids` – (Required) List of subnet IDs.

### kubernetes_network_config

The following arguments are supported in the `kubernetes_network_config` configuration block:

* `ip_family` - (Optional) The IP family used to assign Kubernetes pod and service addresses. Valid values: `ipv4`.
* `service_ipv4_cidr` - (Optional) The CIDR block to assign Kubernetes service IP addresses from. If you don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from 10.96.0.0/12 CIDR block.
The block must meet the following requirements:
    * Within one of the following private IP address blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.
    * Doesn't overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that you selected for VPC.
    * Between /24 and /12.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Cluster ID.
* `certificate_authority` - Nested attribute containing `certificate-authority-data` for your cluster.
    * `data` - The base64 encoded certificate data required to communicate with your cluster. Add this to the `certificate-authority-data` section of the `kubeconfig` file for your cluster.
* `created_at` - The Unix epoch time stamp in seconds for when the cluster was created.
* `id` - The name of the cluster.
* `platform_version` - The platform version for the cluster.
* `status` - The status of the EKS cluster. One of `CLAIMED`, `CREATING`, `DELETED`, `DELETING`, `ERROR`, `MODIFYING`, `PENDING`, `PROVISIONING`, `READY`, `REPAIRING`.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags].
* `vpc_config` -  Nested list containing VPC configuration for the cluster.
    * `cluster_security_group_id` - The cluster security group that was created by CROC Cloud EKS for the cluster.
    * `vpc_id` - The VPC associated with your cluster.

->  **Unsupported attributes**
These attributes are currently unsupported:

* `enabled_cluster_log_types` - The enabled control plane logs. Always empty.
* `encryption_config` - Configuration block with encryption configuration for the cluster. Always empty.
* `endpoint` - The endpoint for your Kubernetes API server. Always `""`.
* `identity` - Nested attribute containing identity provider information for your cluster. Always empty.
* `role_arn` - The ARN of the IAM role that provides permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to API operations on your behalf. Always `""`.
* `vpc_config` - Nested list containing VPC configuration for the cluster.
    * `endpoint_private_access` - Indicates whether or not the EKS private API server endpoint is enabled. Always `false`.
    * `endpoint_public_access` - Indicates whether or not the EKS public API server endpoint is enabled. Always `false`.
    * `public_access_cidrs` - List of CIDR blocks. Indicates which CIDR blocks can access the EKS public API server endpoint. Always empty.

## Timeouts

`aws_eks_cluster` provides the following [Timeouts][timeouts] configuration options:

* `create` - (Default `30 minutes`) How long to wait for the EKS cluster to be created.
* `update` - (Default `60 minutes`) How long to wait for the EKS cluster to be updated.
Note that the `update` timeout is used separately for both `version` and `vpc_config` update timeouts.
* `delete` - (Default `15 minutes`) How long to wait for the EKS cluster to be deleted.

## Import

EKS clusters can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_eks_cluster.my_cluster my_cluster
```
