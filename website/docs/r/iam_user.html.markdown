# Resource: aws_iam_user

Manages an IAM user. For details about IAM users, see the [user documentation][iam-users-and-projects].

## Example Usage

### Predefined Password

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  name     = "tf-user"
  password = "********"
  email    = "example@mail.com"
}
```

### Generated Password

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  name = "tf-user"
}

output "user-password" {
  value     = aws_iam_user.example.password
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Optional, Editable) The displayed name of the user.
  If no value is specified, `name` will be used as the displayed name.
* `email` - (Optional, Editable) The email of the user.

  The value must be 1 to 40 characters long.

~> User names are not case-sensitive. For example, you cannot create user names "TESTUSER" and "testuser" at the same time.

* `otp_required` - (Optional) Indicates whether the user is required to use two-factor authentication to log in to the web interface.
  Defaults to `false`.
* `password` - (Optional, Editable) The password of the user.

~> `password` and `secret_key` are exported only once when the user is created and will not be updated afterwards.
