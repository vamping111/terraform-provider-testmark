# Resource: aws_launch_template

Provides an EC2 launch template resource. Can be used to create instances or auto scaling groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_launch_template" "example" {
  name = "tf-lt"

  block_device_mappings {
    device_name = "disk1"

    ebs {
      volume_size = 20
    }
  }

  disable_api_termination = true

  instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior = "terminate"

  image_id      = "cmi-12345678" # add image id, change instance type if needed
  instance_type = "m1.micro"

  monitoring {
    enabled = true
  }

  placement {
    availability_zone = "ru-msk-vol52"
  }

  tag_specifications {
    resource_type = "instance"

    tags = {
      Name = "tf-lt"
    }
  }
}
```
