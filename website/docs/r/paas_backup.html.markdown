# Resource: aws_paas_backup

Manages a PaaS service backup.

~> Terraform does not create backups of the PaaS service, but tries to gain control over an already created backup.
Use `backup_settings` section in [`aws_paas_service`](paas_service.html.markdown) resource to control the creation of backups.

~> Terraform does not delete the backup when running `terraform destroy`, it will only be removed from the Terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_paas_backups" "selected" {
  service_id = "fm-cluster-12345678"
}

resource "aws_paas_backup" "example" {
  for_each                   = data.aws_paas_backups.selected.backup_ids
  backup_id                  = each.key
  enable_deletion_protection = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `backup_id` - (Required) The ID of the existing PaaS service backup (e.g. `paas-backup-12345678`).
* `enable_deletion_protection` - (Optional) Indicates whether the backup must be protected from automatic scheduled deletion.
* `force_delete` -  (Optional) Indicates whether to delete the backup when running `terraform destroy`.
  If the parameter is set to `false`, the backup will only be removed from Terraform state. Defaults to `false`.
