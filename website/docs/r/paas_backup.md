# Resource: aws_paas_backup

Manages a PaaS service backup.

~> **Note** Terraform does not create backups of the PaaS service, but tries to gain control over an already created backup.
Use `backup_settings` section in [`aws_paas_service`](paas_service.md) resource to control the creation of backups.

~> **Note** Terraform does not delete the backup when running `terraform destroy`, it will only be removed from the Terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_paas_backups" "selected" {
  service_id = "fm-cluster-12345678"
}

resource "aws_paas_backup" "example" {
  for_each                   = data.aws_paas_backups.selected.backup_ids
  backup_id                  = each.key
  enable_deletion_protection = true
}
```
