## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The name of the bucket. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 63 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules may be found in [user documentation][bucket-naming].
* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional, Conflicts with `bucket`, Forces new resource) Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 37 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules may be found in [user documentation][bucket-naming].
* `acl` - (Optional, **Deprecated**, Conflicts with `grant`) The [canned ACL][canned-acl] to apply. Valid values are `private`, `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`. Defaults to `private`. Terraform will only perform drift detection if a configuration value is provided. Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_acl`](s3_bucket_acl.md) instead.
* `grant` - (Optional, **Deprecated**, Conflicts with `acl`) An ACL policy grant. See [Grant](#grant) below for details. Terraform will only perform drift detection if a configuration value is provided. Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_acl`](s3_bucket_acl.md) instead.
* `cors_rule` - (Optional, **Deprecated**) A rule of [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing][cors]. See [CORS rule](#cors-rule) below for details.

  Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration`](s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration.md) instead.
* `policy` - (Optional, **Deprecated**) A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a `terraform plan`. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy.
  Terraform will only perform drift detection if a configuration value is provided.
  Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_policy`](s3_bucket_policy.md) instead.
* `versioning` - (Optional, **Deprecated**) A configuration of the [S3 bucket versioning state][s3-versioning]. See [Versioning](#versioning) below for details.

### CORS Rule

~> **Note** Currently, changes to the `cors_rule` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of CORS rules to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resource instead. If you use `cors_rule` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of CORS rules for the S3 bucket, treating additional CORS rules as drift. For this reason, `cors_rule` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.

The `cors_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `allowed_headers` - (Optional) List of headers allowed.
* `allowed_methods` - (Required) One or more HTTP methods that you allow the origin to execute. Can be `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` or `HEAD`.
* `allowed_origins` - (Required) One or more origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from.
* `expose_headers` - (Optional) One or more headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object).
* `max_age_seconds` - (Optional) Specifies time in seconds that browser can cache the response for a preflight request.

### Grant

~> **Note** Currently, changes to the `grant` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of ACL grants to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource instead. If you use `grant` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of ACL grants for the S3 bucket, treating additional ACL grants as drift. For this reason, `grant` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource for a given S3 bucket.

The `grant` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `id` - (Optional) Canonical user ID to grant for (S3 User ID). Used only when `type` is `CanonicalUser`.
* `type` - (Required) Type of grantee to apply for. Valid values are `CanonicalUser` and `Group`. `AmazonCustomerByEmail` is not supported.
* `permissions` - (Required) List of permissions to apply for grantee. Valid values are `READ`, `WRITE`, `READ_ACP`, `WRITE_ACP`, `FULL_CONTROL`.
* `uri` - (Optional) Uri address to grant for. Supported groups are `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers` and `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`. Used only when `type` is `Group`.

### Lifecycle Rule

~> **Note** Currently, changes to the `lifecycle_rule` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of Lifecycle rules to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource instead. If you use `lifecycle_rule` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of Lifecycle rules for the S3 bucket, treating additional Lifecycle rules as drift. For this reason, `lifecycle_rule` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.

~> **Note** At least one of `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days`, `expiration`, `noncurrent_version_expiration`, must be specified.

The `lifecycle_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule. Must be less than or equal to 255 characters in length.
* `tags` - (Optional) Specifies object tags key and value.
* `enabled` - (Required) Specifies lifecycle rule status.
* `expiration` - (Optional) Specifies a period in the object's expire. See [Expiration](#expiration) below for details.
* `noncurrent_version_expiration` - (Optional) Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. See [Noncurrent Version Expiration](#noncurrent-version-expiration) below for details.

#### Expiration

The `expiration` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `date` - (Optional) Specifies the date after which you want the corresponding action to take effect.
* `days` - (Optional) Specifies the number of days after object creation when the specific rule action takes effect.
* `expired_object_delete_marker` - (Optional) On a versioned bucket (versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket), you can add this element in the lifecycle configuration to direct S3 to delete expired object delete markers. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

#### Noncurrent Version Expiration

The `noncurrent_version_expiration` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `days` - (Required) Specifies the number of days noncurrent object versions expire.

### Versioning

~> **Note** Currently, changes to the `versioning` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of versioning state to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource instead. If you use `versioning` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the versioning state of the S3 bucket, treating additional versioning state changes as drift. For this reason, `versioning` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource for a given S3 bucket.

The `versioning` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket.

### Website

~> **Note** Currently, changes to the `website` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes to the website configuration of an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource instead. If you use `website` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the configuration of the website of the S3 bucket, treating additional website configuration changes as drift. For this reason, `website` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.

The `website` configuration block supports the following arguments:

* `index_document` - (Required, unless using `redirect_all_requests_to`) S3 returns this index document when requests are made to the root domain or any of the subfolders.
* `error_document` - (Optional) An absolute path to the document to return in case of a 4XX error.
* `redirect_all_requests_to` - (Optional) A hostname to redirect all website requests for this bucket to. Hostname can optionally be prefixed with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.
* `routing_rules` - (Optional) A json array containing [routing rules][website-redirect-rules] describing redirect behavior and when redirects are applied.
