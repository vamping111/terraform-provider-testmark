# Resource: aws_connect_instance

Provides an Amazon Connect instance resource. For more information see
[Amazon Connect: Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-get-started.html)

!> **WARN:** There are limits to the number of Connect Instances that can be created in a specific AWS account, and those limits span the life of the account, not just active Instances. Minimize the number of times you create/delete an instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  inbound_calls_enabled    = true
  instance_alias           = "friendly-name-connect"
  outbound_calls_enabled   = true
}
```

## Example Usage with Existing Active Directory

```terraform
resource "aws_connect_instance" "test" {
  directory_id             = aws_directory_service_directory.test.id
  identity_management_type = "EXISTING_DIRECTORY"
  inbound_calls_enabled    = true
  instance_alias           = "friendly-name-connect"
  outbound_calls_enabled   = true
}
```

## Example Usage with SAML

```terraform
