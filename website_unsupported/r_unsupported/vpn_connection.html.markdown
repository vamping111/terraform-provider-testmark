# Resource: aws_vpn_connection

-> **Unsupported resource**
This resource is currently unsupported.

Manages a Site-to-Site VPN connection. A Site-to-Site VPN connection is an Internet Protocol security (IPSec) VPN connection between a VPC and an on-premises network.

For more information about VPN connections, see [user documentation][vpn-connections].

~> **Note:** All arguments including `tunnel1_preshared_key` and `tunnel2_preshared_key` will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state][sensitive-data].

~> **Note:** The CIDR blocks in the arguments `tunnel1_inside_cidr` and `tunnel2_inside_cidr` must have a prefix of /30 and be a part of a specific range.

-> The terms VPC, Internet Gateway, VPN Gateway are equivalent
